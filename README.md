Automatic Face Blur

This project demonstrates an end-to-end application of machine learning in computer vision. The system automatically detects human faces in an image and applies a blur filter to anonymize them.

Features

Uses a pre-trained face detection model (Haar cascades / OpenCV DNN).

Automatically locates all faces in an image.

Applies Gaussian blur to detected face regions.

Supports multiple images and multiple faces per image.

Simple, reproducible Python pipeline.

Skills Demonstrated

Applying ML models for computer vision tasks.

Building a processing pipeline (data input → ML detection → transformation → output).

Integration of machine learning with classical image processing.

Example

Input:

Output (faces blurred):
